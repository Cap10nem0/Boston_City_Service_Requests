# Boston City Service Requests

The COVID-19 pandemic has universally impacted individuals and organizations, manifesting in physical, mental, and financial challenges. Despite some positive developments, such as the widespread adoption of remote work and an increased focus on mental health, the detrimental effects have been significantly more profound. During these arduous times, frontline workers were compelled to maintain a resilient demeanor and continue their essential duties.

One critical resource in this context is the 311 helpline, a dedicated service addressing non-emergency issues ranging from abandoned or stolen vehicles to noise complaints and sanitation concerns. While not available nationwide, it is operational in major cities like New York City and San Francisco, offering a vital communication channel for residents to report various concerns. Upon contacting 311, an operator receives the call, assesses the individual's issues, and dispatches the necessary assistance.

### Objective 

This project has undertaken an examination of request trends from 2015 to 2020, aiming to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced service responsiveness. Through exploratory data analysis, we have investigated several key aspects to discern the pandemic's impact on service delivery and community needs

Key areas of investigation include:

1. What is the distribution of different case types in the dataset?
2. What are the top locations with the highest number of cases?
3. How do the number of cases vary over time?
4. How does season affect number of cases?
5. How are the cases reported to authorities?
6. How has the ratio of opened to closed cases evolved over time?
7. How has the average resolution time changed through years?
8. What is the average resolution time for each type of case?
9. Are there any outliers in the resolution time? If so, what types of cases are associated with these outliers?
10. Is there any correlation between the resolution time and location?
